# news_scrape

I attempted to scrape bloomberg.com for my project. However, for some reason, I could not get it to work. I replaced the bloomberg site with
the one from the activities, and it worked fine. I don't understand why it's not working, and it's unfortunately reached the deadline.

This will be another one of my failures as far as the homework goes.
